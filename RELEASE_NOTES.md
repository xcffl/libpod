# Release Notes

## 1.8.2

### Features
- Initial support for automatically updating containers managed via Systemd unit files has been merged. This allows containers to automatically upgrade if a newer version of their image becomes available

### Bugfixes
- Fixed a bug where unit files generated by `podman generate systemd --new` would not force containers to detach, causing the unit to time out when trying to start
- Fixed a bug where `podman system reset` could delete important system directories if run as rootless on installations created by older Podman ([#4831](https://github.com/containers/libpod/issues/4831))
- Fixed a bug where image built by `podman build` would not properly set the OS and Architecture they were built with ([#5503](https://github.com/containers/libpod/issues/5503))
- Fixed a bug where attached `podman run` with `--sig-proxy` enabled (the default), when built with Go 1.14, would repeatedly send signal 23 to the process in the container and could generate errors when the container stopped ([#5483](https://github.com/containers/libpod/issues/5483))
- Fixed a bug where rootless `podman run` commands could hang when forwarding ports
- Fixed a bug where rootless Podman would not work when `/proc` was mounted with the `hidepid` option set
- Fixed a bug where the `podman system service` command would use large amounts of CPU when `--timeout` was set to 0 ([#5531](https://github.com/containers/libpod/issues/5531))

### HTTP API
- Initial support for Libpod endpoints related to creating and operating on image manifest lists has been added
- The Libpod Healthcheck and Events API endpoints are now supported
- The Swagger endpoint can now handle cases where no Swagger documentation has been generated

### Misc
- Updated Buildah to v1.14.3
- Updated containers/storage to v1.16.5
- Several performance improvements have been made to creating containers, which should somewhat improve the performance of `podman create` and `podman run`

## 1.8.1
### Features
- Many networking-related flags have been added to `podman pod create` to enable customization of pod networks, including `--add-host`, `--dns`, `--dns-opt`, `--dns-search`, `--ip`, `--mac-address`, `--network`, and `--no-hosts`
- The `podman ps --format=json` command now includes the ID of the image containers were created with
- The `podman run` and `podman create` commands now feature an `--rmi` flag to remove the image the container was using after it exits (if no other containers are using said image) ([#4628](https://github.com/containers/libpod/issues/4628))

- Podman previously did not allow the creation of containers with a memory limit lower than 4MB. This restriction has been removed, as the `crun` runtime can create containers with significantly less memory

## 1.6.3
### Features
- Handling of the `libpod.conf` configuration file has seen major changes. Most significantly, rootless users will no longer automatically receive a complete configuration file when they first use Podman, and will instead only receive differences from the global configuration.
- Initial support for the CNI DNS plugin, which allows containers to resolve the IPs of other containers via DNS name, has been added
- Podman now supports anonymous named volumes, created by specifying only a destination to the `-v` flag to the `podman create` and `podman run` commands
- Named volumes now support `uid` and `gid` options in `--opt o=...` to set UID and GID of the created volume

### Bugfixes
- Fixed a bug where the `podman start` command would print container ID, instead of name, when starting containers given their name
- Fixed a bug where named volumes with options did not properly detect issues with mounting the volume, leading to an inconsistent state ([#4303](https://github.com/containers/libpod/issues/4303))

- Support for pushing to and pulling from OSTree has been removed due to deprecation in the containers/image library
- Rootless Podman no longer enables linger on systems with systemd as init by default. As such, containers will now be killed when the user who ran them logs out, unless linger is explicitly enabled using [loginctl](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/loginctl.html)
- Podman will now check the version of `conmon` that is in use to ensure it is sufficient

## 1.6.2
### Features
- Added a `--runtime` flag to `podman system migrate` to allow the OCI runtime for all containers to be reset, to ease transition to the `crun` runtime on CGroups V2 systems until `runc` gains full support
- The `podman rm` command can now remove containers in broken states which previously could not be removed
- The `podman info` command, when run without root, now shows information on UID and GID mappings in the rootless user namespace
- Added `podman build --squash-all` flag, which squashes all layers (including those of the base image) into one layer
- The `--systemd` flag to `podman run` and `podman create` now accepts a string argument and allows a new value, `always`, which forces systemd support without checking if the the container entrypoint is systemd

### Bugfixes
- Fixed a bug where the `podman top` command did not work on systems using CGroups V2 ([#4192](https://github.com/containers/libpod/issues/4192))
- Fixed a bug where rootless Podman could double-close a file, leading to a panic
- Fixed a bug where rootless Podman could fail to retrieve some containers while refreshing the state
- Fixed a bug where `podman start --attach --sig-proxy=false` would still proxy signals into the container
- Fixed a bug where Podman would unconditionally use a non-default path for authentication credentials (`auth.json`), breaking `podman login` integration with `skopeo` and other tools using the containers/image library
- Fixed a bug where `podman ps --format=json` and `podman images --format=json` would display `null` when no results were returned, instead of valid JSON
- Fixed a bug where `podman build --squash` was incorrectly squashing all layers into one, instead of only new layers

- The `podman pod stop` flag now accepts a `--timeout` flag to set the timeout for stopping containers in the pod

### Bugfixes
- Fixed a bug where rootless Podman would fail to start if the default OCI hooks directory is not present

## 0.12.1
### Features
- Rootless Podman now creates the storage.conf, libpod.conf, and mounts.conf configuration files automatically in `~/.config/containers/` for ease of reconfiguration
- The `podman pod create` command can expose ports in the pod's network namespace, allowing public services to be created in pods
- The `podman container checkpoint` command can now keep containers running after they are checkpointed with the `--leave-running` flag
- The `podman container checkpoint` and `podman container restore` commands now support the `--tcp-established` flag to checkpoint and restore containers with active TCP connections
- The `podman version` command now has a `--format` flag to produce machine-readable output
- Added the `podman container exists`, `podman pod exists`, and `podman image exists` commands to easily check for a container/pod/image, respectively, by name or ID
- The `podman ps --pod` flag now has a short alias, `-p`
- The `podman rmi` and `podman rm` commands now have a `--prune` flag to prune unused images and containers, respectively
- The `podman ps` command now has a `--sync` flag to force a sync of Podman's state against the OCI runtime, resolving some state desync errors
- Added the `podman volume` set of commands for creating and managing local-only named volumes

### Bugfixes
- Fixed a breaking change in rootless Podman where a change in default paths caused Podman to be unable to function on systems upgraded from 0.10.x or earlier
- Fixed a bug where `podman exec` without `-t` would still use a terminal if the container was created with `-t`
- Fixed a bug where container root propagation was not being properly adjusted if volumes with root propagation set were mounted into the container
- Fixed a bug where `podman exec` could hold the container lock longer than necessary waiting for an exited container
- Fixed a bug where rootless containers using `slirp4netns` for networking were reporting using `bridge` networking in `podman inspect`
- Fixed a bug where `podman container restore -a` was attempting to restore all containers, including created and running ones. It will now only attempt to restore stopped and exited containers
- Fixed a bug where rootless Podman detached containers were not being properly cleaned up
- Fixed a bug where privileged containers were being mounted with incorrect (too restrictive) mount options such as `nodev`
- Fixed a bug where `podman stop` would throw an error attempting to stop a container that had already stopped

- Fixed a bug where `/dev/shm` was not properly mounted in rootless containers
- Fixed a bug where rootless Podman would set up the CNI plugins for networking (despite not using them in rootless mode), potentially causing `inotify` related errors
- Fixed a bug where Podman would error on numeric GIDs that do not exist in the container's `/etc/group`
- Fixed a bug where containers in pods or created with `--net=container` were not mounting `/etc/resolv.conf` and `/etc/hosts`

### Misc
- `podman build` now defaults the `--force-rm` flag to `true`
- Improved `podman runlabel` support for labels featuring arguments with whitespace
- Containers without a network namespace will now use the host's `resolv.conf`
- The `slirp4netns` network mode can now be used with containers running as root. It may be useful for container-in-container scenarios where the outer container does not have host networking set
- Podman now uses `inotify` to wait for container exit files to be created, instead of polling. If `inotify` cannot be used, Podman will fall back to polling to check if the file has been created
- The `podman logs` command now uses improved short-options handling, allowing its flags to be combined if desired (for example, `podman logs -lf` instead of `podman logs -l -f`)
- Hardcoded OCI hooks directories used by Podman are now deprecated; they should instead be coded into the `libpod.conf` configuration file. They can be specified as an array via `hooks_dir`

- Fixed a bug where Podman was not correctly adding firewall rules for containers, preventing them from accessing the network
- Fixed a bug where full error messages were being lost when creating containers with user namespaces
- Fixed a bug where container state was not properly updated if a failure occurred during network setup, which could cause mounts to be left behind when the container was removed

### Misc
- `podman rm -f` now removes paused containers. As such, `podman rm -af` completing successfully guarantees all Podman containers have been removed
- Added a field to `podman info` to show if Podman is being run as rootless
- Made a small output format change to `podman images` - image sizes now feature a space between number and unit (e.g. `123 MB` now instead of `123MB`)
- Vendored an updated version of `containers/storage` to fix several bugs reported upstream

## 0.11.1
### Features
- Added `--all` and `--latest` flags to `podman checkpoint` and `podman restore`

- Fixed a bug where `podman stats -a` would error if containers were present but not running
- Fixed a bug where container status checks would sometimes leave zombie OCI runtime processes
- Fixed checkpoint and restore code to verify an appropriate version of `criu` is being used
- Fixed a bug where environment variables with no specified value (e.g. `-e FOO`) caused errors (they are now added as empty)
- Fixed a bug where rootless Podman would attempt to configure the system firewall, causing errors on some systems where iptables is not in the user's PATH
- Fixed a bug where rootless Podman was unable to successfully write the container ID to a file when `--cid-file` was specified to `podman run`
- Fixed a bug where `podman unmount` would refuse to unmount a container if it was running (the unmount will now be deferred until the container stops)

- Fixed a bug where `podman info` was not properly reporting the Git commit Podman was built from
- Fixed a bug where `podman run --interactive` was not holding STDIN open when `-a` flag was specified
- Fixed a bug where Podman with the `cgroupfs` CGroup driver was sometimes not successfully removing pod CGroups
- Fixed a bug where rootless Podman was unable to run systemd containers (note that this also requires an update to systemd)
- Fixed a bug where `podman run` with the `--user` flag would fail if the container image did not contain `/etc/passwd` or `/etc/group`

### Misc
- `podman rm`, `podman restart`, `podman kill`, `podman pause`, and `podman unpause` now operate in parallel, greatly improving speed when multiple containers are specified
- `podman create`, `podman run`, and `podman ps` have a number of improvements which should greatly increase their speed
- Greatly improved performance and reduced memory utilization of container status checks, which should improve the speed of most Podman commands

- Podman containers with an IP address now add their hostnames to `/etc/hosts`
- Changed default location of temporary libpod files in rootless Podman
- Updated the default Podman seccomp profile

### Compatibility
Several paths related to rootless Podman had their default values changed in this release.
If paths were not hardcoded in libpod.conf, your system may lose track of running containers and believe they are newly-created.

### Bugfixes
- Fixed a bug where `podman build` would not work while any containers were running

## 0.10.1.2
### Bugfixes
- Fixed cgroup mount for containers using systemd as init to work properly with the systemd cgroup manager

## 0.10.1.1
### Features
- Added handling for running containers as users with numeric UIDs not present in the container's /etc/passwd. This allows getpwuid() to work inside these containers.

## 0.9.3
### Features
- Added a flag to `libpod.conf`, `label`, to globally enable/disable SELinux labelling for libpod
- Added `--mount` flag to `podman create` and `podman run` as a new, more explicit way of specifying volume mounts

### Bugfixes

## 0.9.2.1
### Bugfixes
- Updated Buildah dependency to fix several bugs in `podman build`

### Misc
- Small performance improvement in image handling code to not recalculate digests

## 0.9.2
### Features
- Added `--interval` flag to `podman wait` to determine the interval between checks for container status
- Added a switch in `libpod.conf` to disable reserving ports for running containers. This lowers the safety of port allocations, but can significantly reduce memory usage.
- Added ability to search all the contents of a registry if no image name is specified when using `podman search`

### Bugfixes
- Further fixes for sharing of UTS namespaces within pods
- Fixed a deadlock in containers/storage that could be caused by numerous parallel Podman processes.

- Fixed default mount propagation on volume mounts
- Fixed default mounts under /dev remaining if /dev is bind-mounted into the container
- Fixed rootless `podman create` with no command specified throwing an error

### Misc
- Added `podman rm --volumes` flag for compatibility with Docker. As Podman does not presently support named volumes, this does nothing for now, but provides improved compatibility with the Docker command line.
- Improved error messages from `podman pull`

### Compatibility
- Podman is no longer being built by default with support for the Devicemapper storage driver. If you are using this storage driver, you should investigate switching to overlayfs.

## 0.9.1.1
### Bugfixes
- Added support for configuring iptables and firewalld firewalls to allow container traffic. This should resolve numerous issues with network access in containers.

### Note
It is recommended that you restart your system firewall after installing this release to clear any firewall rules created by older Podman versions. If port forwarding to containers does not work, it is recommended that you restart your system.

## 0.9.1
### Features
- Added initial support for the `podman pod` command as non-root

### Bugfixes
- Fixed regression where invalid Podman commands would still cause a clean exit
- Fixed `podman rmi --all` to not error if no images are present on the system
- Fixed parsing of container logs with `podman logs` to properly handle CRI logging, fixing some issues with blank lines in logs
- Fixed a bug creating pod cgroups using the systemd cgroup driver with systemd versions 239 and higher
- Fixed handling of volume mounts that overlapped with default container mounts (for example, `podman run -v /dev/:/dev`)
- Fixed sharing of UTS namespace in pods

### Misc
- Added additional debug information when pulling images if `--log-level=debug` is specified
- `podman build` now defaults to caching intermediate layers while building

## 0.8.5
### Features
- Added the ability to add a multipart entrypoint with `podman run --entrypoint`

- Greatly improved support for containers which use systemd as init

### Bugfixes
- Fixed several bugs with rootless `podman exec`
- Fixed rootless `podman` with a symlinked storage directory crashing
- Fixed bug with `podman ps` and multiple filters where the interface did not match Docker
- Fixed handling of `resolv.conf` on the host to handle symlinks
- Increased open file descriptor and process limits to match Docker and Buildah
- Fixed `podman run -h` to specify the container's hostname (as it does in Docker) instead of printing help text
- Fixed a bug with image shortname handling where repositories were incorrectly being treated as registries
- Fixed a bug where `podman wait` was busywaiting and consuming large amounts of CPU

## 0.8.4
### Features
- Added the `podman pod top` command
- Added the ability to easily share namespaces within a pod
- Added a pod statistics endpoint to the Varlink API
